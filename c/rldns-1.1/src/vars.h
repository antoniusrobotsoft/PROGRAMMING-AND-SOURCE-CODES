for a resolver 
this dns software has 2 types method to resolve a name request
- Resolver Type 1, if more than 1 ip to resolve, this will do a dns based load balancing without randomizing ip addresses (for a name request only)
- Resolver Type 2, if more than 1 ip to resolve, this will randomize multiple ip sequences for dns based load balancing (for a name request only)
By default, resolver type is 2 (suggested for best a name resolve performance)
